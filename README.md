#WDI-SECOND-PROJECT
##A Full-stack Application

###The project idea:
[My project](https://makeupstarterkit.herokuapp.com/)
is an app to do lists on. The theme is makeup starter kit. The idea is to make anyone new to makeup to do an inventory of products they already have and a wish list of product they might want to get to have everything needed to do makeups.

###Overview:

My Express application uses hashed passwords and an authentication to let users create their own content for two lists ("Thing I want to get" and "Things I already have"). I use two models (user and list with an embedded relationship) and ReSTful routes. For CSS I use SCSS and Bootstrap.

Styling: the target group would be teenagers who'd start to use makeup or anyone who instead of shopping cosmetics on an impuls wants to make an inventory of their makeup kit. Although the majority of possible users probably are female I didn't want to make the visual style of the app too girly. My aim would be more ninja-style with a bold colour choice to attract my target group. I'm especially happy to have been able to make it fully responsive.

### The process
I used Balsamiq for doing wireframes and Trello to plan the project and the different tasks. My project to-do list on Trello on day one of the project:

My project to-do list on Trello on the fourth (4/5) day.

Here is my original wireframes made using Balsamiq. The final app looks different. I changed the static index page, removed the create list function and restricted the editing of the lists to one list at a time. I made the process to create lists and add items much more complicated than it had to be. I think I learned alot about the planning and adjusting plans during the process.

###I would implement given some more time:
I would use an API to search for products and prices and add a link to take you to a online store to purchase the product you don't have yet.

I would also use more time on the styling over all but specifically the lists index view and the flash messages, would also add icons to the two lists.
